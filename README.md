## Brief Description

Solutions for the Projects - AI for Trading Nanodegree.

This is an extremely interesting Nanodegree if you want to apply Artificial Intelligence to track
patterns in the Financial Markets. It will give you a good grasp on how the Financial Sector can
benefit from the use of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to read reports and statements. The topics and projects include:

* Basic of quantitative analysis, including data processing, trading signal generation, and portfolio management. Use Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

* Stocks and common terminology used for analysis.

* Modern Market functions: How trades are executed, analyse price and volume data to identify potential trading signals.

* Data Processing: How to adjust market data for corporate actions, include fundamental information in your analysis and compute technical indicators.

* Stock Returns: How to calculate stock returns, and log returns in particular. Learn why log returns are used to analyze financial data.

* Momentum Trading: Alpha signals, and how they can be applied to a long/short trading strategy. Learn about momentum, a common alpha signal used in trading strategies.
