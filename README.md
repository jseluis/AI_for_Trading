## Brief Description

My Solutions for the Projects - AI for Trading Nanodegree at Udacity

#### This is an extremely interesting Nanodegree if you want to apply Artificial Intelligence to track patterns in the Financial Markets. The topics and projects include:

* Basic of quantitative analysis, including data processing, trading signal generation, and portfolio management. Use Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

* Stocks and common terminology used for analysis.

* Modern Market functions: How trades are executed, analyse price and volume data to identify potential trading signals.

* Data Processing: How to adjust market data for corporate actions, include fundamental information in your analysis and compute technical indicators.

* Stock Returns: How to calculate stock returns, and log returns in particular. Learn why log returns are used to analyze financial data.

* Momentum Trading: Alpha signals, and how they can be applied to a long/short trading strategy. Learn about momentum, a common alpha signal used in trading strategies.

* Quant Workflow: Overall quant workflow, including alpha signal generation, alpha combination, portfolio optimization, and trading.

* Outliers and Filtering: Importance of outliers and how to detect them. Learn about methods designed to handle outliers.

* Regression: Regression, and related statistical tools that pre-process data before regression analysis. See how regression relates to trading and other more advanced methods.

* Time Series Modeling: Advanced methods for time series analysis, including ARMA, ARIMA, Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, and recurrent neural networks.

* Volatility: Stock volatility, and how the GARCH model analysis volatility. See how volatility is used in equity trading.

* Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion: Pairs trading, and study the tools used in identifying stock pairs and making trading decisions.

* Stocks, Indices, Funds: Gain an overview of stocks, indices and funds. Also learn how to construct an index.

* ETFs: Learn about Exchanged Traded Funds (ETFs) and how they are used by investors and fund managers.

* Portfolio Risk and Return: Fundamentals of portfolio theory, which are key to designing portfolios for mutual funds, hedge funds and ETFs.

* Portfolio Optimization: Optimize portfolios to meet certain criteria and constraints. Get hands on experience in optimizing a portfolio with the cvxpy Python library.

## Projects
