## Brief Description

My Solutions for the Projects - AI for Trading Nanodegree at Udacity

#### This is an extremely interesting Nanodegree if you want to apply Artificial Intelligence to track patterns in the Financial Markets. Personally, it was really good to grasp how the Financial Sector can benefit from the use of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to read reports and statements, and many other applications. The topics and projects include:

* Basic of quantitative analysis, including data processing, trading signal generation, and portfolio management. Use Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

* Stocks and common terminology used for analysis.

* Modern Market functions: How trades are executed, analyse price and volume data to identify potential trading signals.

* Data Processing: How to adjust market data for corporate actions, include fundamental information in your analysis and compute technical indicators.

* Stock Returns: How to calculate stock returns, and log returns in particular. Learn why log returns are used to analyze financial data.

* Momentum Trading: Alpha signals, and how they can be applied to a long/short trading strategy. Learn about momentum, a common alpha signal used in trading strategies.

* Quant Workflow: Overall quant workflow, including alpha signal generation, alpha combination, portfolio optimization, and trading.

* Outliers and Filtering: Importance of outliers and how to detect them. Learn about methods designed to handle outliers.

* Regression: Regression, and related statistical tools that pre-process data before regression analysis. See how regression relates to trading and other more advanced methods.

* Time Series Modeling: Advanced methods for time series analysis, including ARMA, ARIMA, Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, and recurrent neural networks.

* Volatility: Stock volatility, and how the GARCH model analysis volatility. See how volatility is used in equity trading.

* Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion: Pairs trading, and study the tools used in identifying stock pairs and making trading decisions.

## Projects
